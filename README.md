# k-NN-Predictions
Introductory ML console application that allows the user to select category and run predictions using the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classification algorithm

# What the KNN Algorithm?
KNN falls in the supervised learning family of algorithms. Informally, this means that we are given a labelled dataset consisting of training observations.

This algorithm can be used for both classification and regression predictive problems. However, it is more widely used in classification problems in the industry. KNN can be used in the variety of applications such as finance, healthcare, political science, handwriting detection, image recognition and video recognition.

The KNN algorithm is a robust and versatile classifier that is often used as a benchmark for more complex classifiers such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Despite its simplicity, KNN can outperform more powerful classifiers and is used in a variety of applications such as economic forecasting, data compression and genetics.
